# Maze Path-Planning

This is the maze path-planning code, for Runing this code, run the maze.py file and the program will start to calculate the path between start and end. Based on the size of the map it could be a bit slow.

We used a_star.py code from https://github.com/AtsushiSakai/PythonRobotics.git and made some change for work with our map.
